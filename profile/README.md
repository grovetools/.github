### Local-first, terminal-based toolkit for AI-assisted software development

Grove aims to make coding with AI feel more deliberate, controlled, and organized. It serves as an orchestration layer for agents like Claude Code and LLM API calls, with tools for context engineering, markdown-based task orchestration, workspace discovery, project navigation, and scenario-based testing. It integrates with tmux and Neovim.
